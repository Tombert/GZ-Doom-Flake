# My Simple GZ Doom Flake

I run Jovian Nixos, and I wanted to add some Doom engine games. I wanted to make sure my games ran consistently, so I made a flake.  It's not a great or amazing flake, I just wanted to version it and let anyone who wants to use it use it.

## How to use? 

You need to supply your own WAD files for the games, since I can't distribute them. The current flake supports Chex Quest 1, 2, and 3, Stife, Heretic, and Hexen. It's very easy to modify if you want to add other stuff. 

You'll also need to download the aim assist plugin for this to work out of the box (which I use because I play these games with an Xbox controller). If you don't want to use that remove the aim assist part of the exec command.
